# Simple Shell


It‚Äôs time for the famous Simple Shell project.
This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot 

- Basics of programming
- Basics of C
- Basics of thinking like an engineer
- Group work
- And Learning how to learn


## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

 - Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell
 - Approaching a Project

## Background Context

Write a simple UNIX command interpreter.


## Learning Objectives

- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / ‚Äúend-of-file‚Äù?








## More Info

### Output

- Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below).

Example of error with sh:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
``````
Same error with your program hsh:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
``````
## List of allowed functions and system calls

- signal (man 2 signal)
- stat (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
- lstat (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
- fstat (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)

## man or help

- sh (Run sh as well)

## Compilation

Your shell will be compiled this way:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
## Testing

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```
